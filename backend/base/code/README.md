# FHE Benchmarking Suite - Face Verification

> **CryptoFace-Latti-GPU H200 package.** This checkout keeps the upstream
> stage-by-stage harness and replaces its reference submission with the Latti
> GPU adapter. Native code and LattiSense are built locally from the pinned
> private `human-analysis/latti-ai` and `human-analysis/lattisense` sources;
> no prebuilt executable or shared library is tracked.

For a clean NVIDIA H200 machine (compute capability 9.0):

```console
bash scripts/install_system_deps.sh
bash scripts/install_python_deps.sh
bash scripts/build_submission.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 harness/run_submission.py 0 --seed 42
```

The machine must already have a working NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit with
`nvcc`. The H200 port is source-complete but must pass the single-pair and
larger numerical gates on the target machine before its historical Blackwell
measurements are treated as reproduced; see
`submission/latti/validation/H200_STATUS.md`.

This repository contains the harness for the face-verification workload of the
FHE benchmarking suite from
[HomomorphicEncryption.org](https://homomorphicencryption.org/).

The repository includes a
[CryptoFace](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Ao_CryptoFace_End-to-End_Encrypted_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2025_paper.html)
reference submission under `submission/`, implemented with
[Latti-AI](https://github.com/human-analysis/latti-ai) and
[RNS-CKKS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/931).

Submitters clone this repository and replace the contents of `submission/` with
their own implementation. This README defines the normative workload interface.

## Prerequisites

### System dependencies

`scripts/install_system_deps.sh` installs the host build and preprocessing
packages via `apt`, including:

- `build-essential`, `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `patch` — native build tools
- `golang-go`, `libgmp-dev`, `libhdf5-dev`, `libomp-dev` — Latti dependencies
- `libgl1`, `libglib2.0-0`, `libsm6`, `libxext6`, `libxrender1` — InsightFace/OpenCV runtime libraries

```console
bash scripts/install_system_deps.sh
```

### Python dependencies

The setup uses Python 3.12 and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The installer
uses an existing `uv`, or bootstraps a private copy when it is absent.

`requirements.txt` contains the harness and client-preprocessing dependencies.
Native Latti dependencies are pinned and built by `scripts/build_submission.sh`.

```console
bash scripts/install_python_deps.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Activate `.venv` in each new shell before running the harness. All commands
below assume that environment is active.

### Dataset and model

The benchmark dataset is hosted on Hugging Face and downloaded automatically on
the first run (cached under `~/.cache/huggingface`). The
architecture-independent compiled Latti task and model parameters are tracked
under `submission/latti/model`; native runtime code is always built locally.

| Artifact | Hugging Face repo | Pulled by |
|---|---|---|
| `face_dataset.npy` + `face_dataset_labels.txt` | [`halmsu/celeba-1024-pairs`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/halmsu/celeba-1024-pairs) (dataset) | harness `generate_dataset.py` -> indexed `datasets/face_dataset.h5` |

The dataset contains 1,024 screened CelebA pairs: 512 genuine and 512 impostor
pairs. It preserves the original variable-size JPEG images. The input generator
decodes them without resizing, and the reference submission performs face
detection, landmark alignment, cropping, and only then resizes the aligned crop
for CryptoFace. The four benchmark variants sample 1, 128, 256, or all 1,024
pairs from this master set.

Evaluation uses `datasets/face_dataset.h5` as a random-access store with
`image0`, `image1`, and `labels` datasets and schema version 1. The current
hosted NPY dataset is migrated once on first use. Larger datasets should be
provided directly in this indexed format; the harness then reads only selected
labels and the current image chunk instead of loading the source dataset.

**Offline / local override.** To run without dataset network access, place
either an indexed `face_dataset.h5` or the two legacy dataset files in
`datasets/`. Existing local files are used in preference to the download.

## Running the benchmark

### Reproducible artifact storage

The harness can keep regenerable working data off the repository filesystem.
Set `CRYPTOFACE_ARTIFACT_ROOT` or put the artifact root path in the ignored
`.cryptoface-artifact-root` file at the repository root. Downloaded/indexed
datasets, generated keys and ciphertexts, and all benchmark `io` then live
under that root. Durable `measurements/results-*.json` files remain under the
repository's `measurements/` directory.

On the MSU cluster, home checkouts should point this setting into
`/mnt/gs21/scratch/vishnu/cryptoface`. Scratch content is reproducible and may
be purged after 45 days without modification; source code and final results
must remain in home storage.

For every submission-owned stage, the harness runs the first available entry
point: `submission/<stage>.py` with the active Python interpreter, or
`submission/build/<stage>` as a native executable. Commands run from the
repository root. Stages that take a size argument receive `0`, `1`, `2`, or
`3`, corresponding to 1, 128, 256, or 1,024 pairs. A stage must exit nonzero
on failure and must finish writing its output before it reports success.

```console
python3 harness/run_submission.py -h
```

```
usage: run_submission.py [-h] [--num_runs NUM_RUNS] [--seed SEED]
                         {0,1,2,3}

Run Face Verification FHE benchmark.

positional arguments:
  {0,1,2,3}            Instance size (0-single/1-small/2-medium/3-large)

options:
  --num_runs NUM_RUNS  Number of times to run stages 4-10 (default: 1)
  --seed SEED          Random seed for reproducible pair sampling (default: 42).
                       Fixed by default so all submissions sample identical pairs.
```

### Example: single-pair smoke test

```console
python3 harness/run_submission.py 0 --seed 42
```

### Example: small size, two runs

```console
python3 harness/run_submission.py 1 --seed 3 --num_runs 2
```

The four variants contain 1, 128, 256, and 1,024 face pairs. Batched variants
report EER and TAR at FAR=1%/0.1% for both the encrypted CryptoFace model and
the included [ArcFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698) baseline, together
with their paired metric differences.

Results are written to `measurements/` as JSON files (`results-1.json`,
`results-2.json`, …).

## Pipeline stages

The harness drives the following sequence. It owns stages 0, 1, 4, and 10;
stages 2, 3, and 5–9 belong to the submission.

| Stage | Script | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | harness | Remove and re-create `io/<size>/` |
| 1 | harness | Provision and validate indexed `datasets/face_dataset.h5` |
| 2 | submission | `client_key_generation` — generate client secret and public/evaluation key material |
| 3 | submission | `server_preprocess_model` — compile/cache packed model weights and validate the persisted input level |
| 4 | harness | `generate_input.py` — sample row indices and create an indexed input store |
| 5 | submission | `client_preprocess_input` — face alignment and patch extraction |
| 6 | submission | `client_encode_encrypt_input` — encode and encrypt patches |
| 7 | submission | `server_encrypted_compute` — bounded parallel encrypted face verification |
| 8 | submission | `client_decrypt_decode` — decrypt similarity scores |
| 9 | submission | `client_postprocess` — optional postprocessing |
| 10 | harness | ArcFace baseline, EER/TAR@FAR metrics, and paired comparison |

Stages 4–10 repeat for each `--num_runs` iteration.

The required final output is
`io/<size>/encrypted_model_predictions.txt`: exactly one finite floating-point
similarity score per input pair, in input order, with one score per line and a
final newline. A submission may choose its other intermediate filenames under
`io/<size>/`.

Client secret material must not be loaded by stages 3 or 7. Cleartext images,
plaintext features, and decrypted scores must not be made available to the
server stage. Public/evaluation keys, encrypted inputs, packed model weights,
and encrypted results may cross the client/server boundary.

## File I/O contract

| Path | Written by | Read by |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `datasets/face_dataset.h5` | harness stage 1 migration, or supplied directly | random-access source for harness stage 4 |
| `datasets/face_dataset_provenance.json` | harness stage 1 | local audit only; never read by server stages |
| `datasets/<size>/intermediate/test_selection.npz` | harness stage 4 | bounded chunk materializer |
| `datasets/<size>/intermediate/test_pairs.h5` | conventional input materializer | submission stage 5 |
| `datasets/<size>/intermediate/test_labels.txt` | harness stage 4 | harness stage 10 |
| `io/<size>/secret_key/sk.h5` | submission stage 2 | client stage 8 only |
| `io/<size>/public_keys/keys.h5` | submission stage 2 | submission stages 3, 6, 7, 8 |
| `submission/circuit_manifest.json` | submission | client stage 2, server stages 3 and 7 |
| `io/<size>/public_keys/input_level.txt` | client stage 2 | server stage 3, client stage 6 |
| `io/server_data/` | submission stage 3 (provider-defined packed-model artifacts) | submission stage 7; harness measurement after stage 3 |
| `io/<size>/server_model.json` | server stage 3 | server stage 7 |
| `io/<size>/server_reported.json` | submission stage 7 (optional) | harness |
| `io/<size>/provenance.json` | reference submission stage 3 | server model/configuration audit only; not copied into measurement JSON |
| `io/<size>/intermediate/preprocessed_patches.h5` | submission stage 5 | submission stage 6 |
| `io/<size>/ciphertexts_upload/*.h5` | client stage 6 | server stage 7 |
| `io/<size>/ciphertexts_download/*.h5` | server stage 7 | client stage 8 |
| `io/<size>/encrypted_model_predictions.txt` | submission stage 8 or 9 | harness stage 10 |
| `io/<size>/harness_model_predictions.txt` | harness stage 10 | harness stage 10 |

`io/server_data/` is the backend-neutral boundary for persistent server-side
model artifacts. Stage 3 must create this directory and place every serialized
artifact required by encrypted inference beneath it. The harness recursively
measures the complete directory as `Packed model weights`; file names, formats,
and nesting are chosen by the submission provider. All retained content is
counted, including auxiliary tables, manifests, and multiple cache entries, so
providers are responsible for removing stale or unrelated data.

The stage-4 HDF5 input contains equally sized `image0` and `image1`
variable-length `uint8` datasets. Each element is an encoded RGB image, and
rows retain benchmark input order. The labels file contains one `0` (impostor)
or `1` (genuine) label per pair in the same order.

A submission may also write `server_reported.json`, mapping timing labels to numeric seconds with nested metadata allowed. These reports supplement rather than replace the harness's own wall-time measurements.

## Performance and quality measurement

The harness measures elapsed wall-clock time between stage completion markers,
including any intervening harness artifact-size collection. Stages 1–3 run once
and form `Offline setup total`; stages 4–10 run once per requested iteration and
form `Online evaluation total`. `Timing["Total"]` is their sum. Values under
`Server Reported` are optional submission diagnostics and may include both wall
time and summed worker-seconds; they are not added to the harness total.

`Bandwidth` reports serialized artifact sizes. The harness measures public and evaluation keys, encrypted inputs, encrypted results, and packed model weights (from the `io/server_data` directory) from disk.

Quality is face-verification quality, not classification accuracy. Stage 10
first verifies the exact score count and rejects non-finite scores. For each
batched variant, it evaluates the encrypted model and the included ArcFace
baseline on the same sampled pairs, then sweeps every distinct similarity
threshold over all pairs. It reports:

Both the reference submission and ArcFace use InsightFace's Buffalo-L detector
with an explicit single 640x640 detector pass. The submission aligns that
detector's landmarks into its 64x64 CryptoFace input, while ArcFace performs its
own aligned recognition crop. Fixing the detector scale avoids
version-dependent face selection and alignment.

- equal error rate (EER), interpolated where false-accept and false-reject rates
  meet; lower is better;
- true-accept rate (TAR) at false-accept rate (FAR) at most 1% and 0.1%; higher
  is better; and
- encrypted-minus-ArcFace gaps for all three metrics.

A batched run passes when its encrypted EER is no more than 0.15 above the
ArcFace EER on the same pairs. A single-pair smoke test reports only its score
and ground-truth label because EER and TAR are not meaningful for one sample.
Formal batched benchmark numbers are the average of three runs. The single-pair
variant is a smoke test and is reported from one run, as described in
[`measurements/README.md`](measurements/README.md).

The same score validation and metric calculation are available independently:

```console
python3 harness/verify_result.py <labels-file> <scores-file> [tag]
```
